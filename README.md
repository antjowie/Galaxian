![game showcase](resources/docs/game.gif)  
This is my attempt at recreating the classic arcade game Galaxian in C++. This was a school project. The framework that manages graphics and input is supplied by the school.

## How to run it
I have included build binaries in the repo. Just go to bin/x64/Release and download the folder, after that, just run the .exe. Be sure that the folder is not zipped and that all the files in the folder are included.


## How to build it
It is build using Visual Studio 2017. The solution file is located in proj/VS2017/. You can use the MSVC with this or open in with VS2017 and build it.
